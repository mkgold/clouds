This course explores the cloud as condition, metaphor, and infrastructure of the modern web. Our aim will be to come to know and theorize the materiality of the network in ways that account for not only its presence in the physical world, but also its rootedness in a variety of social and political contexts. We will explore local instantiations of cloud infrastructure in an effort to trace the material nature of the internet; explore fictional, theoretical, and philosophical accounts of the network; look at the environmental consequences of networked infrastructures; and play, when possible, with cloud-based reading and writing practices. By the end of the semester, we will have viewed “the cloud” from a variety of perspectives that reveal it to be not a virtual abstraction, but rather a set of material, social, and political infrastructures embedded in our lives.

**Assignments:**

**Annotated Bibliography & Presentation** <br />
Sign up:  http://www.SignUpGenius.com/go/4090E4AAFA929A46-clouds <br />
Choose a research topic related to the course and find texts (at least 5 for students in the 3-credit version of the course and at least 10 for students in the 4-credit version) related to it (articles or books count equally as a text. For each text, provide a bibliographical citation in MLA format and a 1-2 paragraph description of the text. Your description should gloss the argument/contribution of the text in question and should also explain its relevance to your research topic. Be sure to explore academic databases from the GC Library such as the MLA International Bibliography as you are doing research. For more on writing an annotated bibliography, please see this resource: http://guides.library.cornell.edu/annotatedbibliography.

Your annotated bibliography is due on the date of your presentation. It should be posted to our course blog in the “Annotated Bibliographies” category, tagged with terms related to your topic. In your presentation, you should introduce us to your research topic and walk us through the sources you’ve explored.

**Blog Posts**<br />
Create a post on our course blog related to our readings. You might provide a reaction to something we’ve read; share resources related to the course; or work through ideas related to our class discussions. For more on academic blogging, please consult this guide: http://twp.duke.edu/uploads/media_items/blogging-introduction.original.pdf 

3 posts minimum required for 3-credit course number; 4 posts minimum required for 4-credit course number.

**Cloud text experiment**<br />
This assignment asks you to experiment and play, in some way, with a cloud-based writing system such as Twitter. You can create a twitterbot by following this guide by GC Digital Fellow Patrick Smyth - https://github.com/smythp/twitter-workshop, create a networked performance of some kind along the lines of Ian Bogost’s Bloomsday experiment -- http://bogost.com/writing/blog/bloomsday_on_twitter/, or do something else entirely. The goal here is to explore the affordances of cloud-based writing in some way, ideally inspired by our course readings. 

Write a blog post on our course blog describing your experiment in the category “Cloud Text Experiments.” (note: this blog post is in addition to your other required blog posts)


**Final Presentation**<br />
On December 6, you will be asked to give a 5-7 minute presentation on your final paper project. You should introduce the class to the subject of your research and begin to describe the argument you are making in your paper. Not required of auditors.

**Final Paper or Project**<br />
Your final paper (15-20 pages for 3-credit students, 20-25 pages for 4-credit students; not required of auditors) should explore a topic of research related to the course materials. You should submit a short (no more than one page) proposal about your topic on November 15. In your paper, focus particularly on your argument; discuss sources insofar as they help you advance your argument, but make sure that throughout the paper (and particularly in your transition sentences at the beginning of every paragraph), you are putting the focus on the argument you are trying to make.

Should you wish to create a digital project of some kind for this class rather than a final paper, please meet with Prof. Gold to discuss.
